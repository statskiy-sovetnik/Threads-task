From the perspective of natural resources, vast Siberia has always been, and remains, the essential region for all of Russia. In the late 1950s, Siberia provided the country with 75% of its coal and possessed 80% of the nation's hydroelectric resources. Siberia quickly became industrialized, but science then was largely of the applied variety and did not satisfy its needs. The USSR Academy of Sciences came to understand that there was a need to develop fundamental science. In 1958, this concept was implemented with the establishment of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union at Akademgorodok, near the large industrial city of Novosibirsk. From the very beginning, the founders of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet (now Russian) Academy of Sciences were concerned about providing the future scientific center with highly-trained personnel. In order to create a consistent source of personnel replenishment for Siberian scientific institutions, it was necessary to provide advanced training on the spot, thus the idea was born to establish a university in Novosibirsk. Now the third-most populous city in Russia, Novosibirsk is ranked 93 on the QS Best Student Cities rating.

Following its establishment in 1959, Novosibirsk State University quickly grew. During its first nine years, 900 professionals were trained on its campus which comprised eight departments, had an instructional faculty of 270, and conducted research in a total of 46 sections.

Russia's premier scientists lectured at the University and many new applied science programs were established throughout the Soviet Union.

Novosibirsk State University was from its inception a unique institution, existing in close collaborative association with research and development institutions of which there are several dozen within an area of only 1.5 square km. The project of an "akademgorodok," an academic town with a University as its core, was even exhibited at the 1967 World Expo in Montreal, after which Novosibirsk's Akademgorodok became model for other academic towns throughout the Soviet Union.

Research
Novosibirsk State University is Russia's largest scientific and educational centre. Situated in the research center of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences - Akademgorodok - with its 35 research institutes and innovative technopark, NSU's students have the opportunity to perform research in more than 100 research laboratories. The University aims to train high-profile specialists to assume leadership roles in science, education and science-intensive industries.

Novosibirsk State University's principal areas of teaching and research include, but are not limited to elementary particle physics, photonics and quantum optics, Arctic research, biomedicine and cancer therapy, chemical engineering, low-dimensional hybrid materials, omic technologies, mathematics, archaeology and ethnography, and linguistics among other disciplines.

Interdisciplinary Centre for Elementary Particle Physics and Astrophysics
The Novosibirsk State University Interdisciplinary Centre for Elementary Particle Physics and Astrophysics (ICEPPA) links 13 laboratories working in the fields of elementary particle physics and astrophysics.

The Interdisciplinary Centreís Laboratories participate in large international collaborative scientific projects including experiments in the fields of high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmic ray physics. The Centre is currently engaged in the following research projects:

Astrophysics Cosmology and Cosmic Rays
Experiments on electron-positron colliders
Experiments on hadron colliders
Search for new physical phenomena in experiments with intense muon beams. The Laboratory for Exploration for Interactions Outside the Standard Model Framework participates in the preparation of two experiments at Fermilab (USA). One experiment, Mu2e, is the search for the conversion of a muon into an electron when interacting with nuclei, while the other experiment, g-2, is devoted to a precise measurement of the magnetic moment of the muon.
Development of new detectors and colliders.
The Aston-Novosibirsk State University International Centre for Photonics
The main objective of the Centre is to develop a physical platform aimed at the application of advanced knowledge in laser technologies, in long-distance communication and in medical sensing devices technologies.

The Centre's principal areas of research include:

advanced concepts and fundamental new theories in nonlinear photonic devices and systems
new technologies for optical communications, lasers, safe data transmission and medicine
practical applications of developed technologies in high-speed coherent optical communications, in advanced laser systems for scientific, industrial and medical applications, and in innovative systems for safe data transmission.
The Center for Photonics was created in partnership with Aston University (UK) and offers NSU students access to world-class laboratories in the field of high-speed optical communications, fiber-optic and femtosecond laser technologies.

International collaborations
Research groups are involved in 38 international collaborations;[1]

NSU has six international collaborations in the field of physics, elementary particles and astrophysics and 12 ongoing collaborations with the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

NSU has partnership agreements with 141 universities [2] representing 27 countries.

Education for International Students
Grants and Scholarships
Every year, international students have an opportunity to apply for the Russian Government Scholarship which covers full tuition and provides a monthly living allowance. Travel costs, living expenses and a health insurance policy are not included. These Scholarships are granted on a competitive basis; the selection criteria and procedures as well as the number of scholarships available depend on the home country of applicant. The application procedure begins in January each year and the deadline (March-June) varies according to the home country of the applicant.

Additionally, students from NSU's partner universities have the opportunity to freely apply to such programs as Erasmus+, DAAD, and the Fulbright Program, among others.
